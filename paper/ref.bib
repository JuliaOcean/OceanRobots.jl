abstract = {An estimate is made of the three-dimensional global oceanic temperature and salinity variability, omitting the seasonal cycle, both as a major descriptive element of the ocean circulation and for use in the error estimates of state estimation. Historical hydrography, recent data from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, and {Argo} profile data are all used. Root-mean-square vertical displacements in the upper 300 m of the ocean are generally smaller than 50 m, except in energetic boundary currents and in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. Variability in temperature and salinity is strongly correlated below the top 100 m. Salinity contributions to sea surface height variability appear more significant at low latitudes than expected, possibly resulting from advective and diffusive processes. Results are generally consistent with altimetric variability under two simple kinematic hypotheses, and much of the observed structure coincides with known dynamical features. A large fraction of the sea surface height variability is consistent with the hypothesis of dominance of the first baroclinic mode. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},
