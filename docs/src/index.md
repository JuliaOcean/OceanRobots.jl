# OceanRobots.jl

This package can be used to access, analyze, process, and simulate data generated by _ocean robots_. These ocean observing platforms collect observations in the field, and allow us to monitor climate.

`OceanRobots.jl` includes profiling floats, drifters, gliders, and moorings as illustrated in the examples. It provides a unified and simple user interface to each of these data sets.
